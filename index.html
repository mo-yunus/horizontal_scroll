                <p>The avocado (Persea americana) is a tree, long thought to have originated in South Central Mexico,
                    classified as a member of the flowering plant family Lauraceae. The fruit of the plant, also called
                    an avocado (or avocado pear or alligator pear), is botanically a large berry containing a single
                    large seed known as a "pit" or a "stone".</p>

                    TOMATO
                </div>
                <p>The tomato is the edible, often red, berry of the nightshade Solanum lycopersicum, commonly known as
                    tomato plant. The species originated in the western South America. The Nahuatl (Aztec language) word
                    tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato derived.</p>
